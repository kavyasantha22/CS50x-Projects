sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: fastest in sorted data

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: the fastest for reverse(which should be n^2 scenario for bubble and selection) and random(which should be average time)

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: slowest in sorted data (which, if its bubble it only needs n time)
